The Odin Project Foundations - Project: Make An Online Calculator 
https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator

Other work commitments put this project on hold a number of times for many weeks, recently revisited it:

Main branch currently contains work in progress

Other branches show 'development process', ideas, experiments 

Currently the calculator will evaluate one sum
Next steps are:
- allow it to evaluate a series of sums, 
- add in decimal point, 'clear' and 'backspace' functionality, round of decimal point numbers, 
- debug 
- finish the HTML and CSS including accessibility checks 
- add in keyboard support

Aim: basic maths calculator that simply does the sums you want it to. 

Takes input by user clicking on buttons or entering numbers and operators with keyboard. 

Outputs: to a 'calculator display panel' showing user input then the sum's total. 

Skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
