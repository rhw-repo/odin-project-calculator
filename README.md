The Odin Project Foundations - Project: Make An Online Calculator 

Early look at development process - 

First approach: 
Starting the CSS & rendering the numbers & operators using DOM methods (version 1 halted, pushed here)

Second approach:
Using data attributes to define number key presses versus operator key presses (in progress)

Aim: basic maths calculator that simply does the sums you want it to. 
Takes input by user clicking on buttons or entering numbers and operators with keyboard. 

Skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
