Problem: make an online basic maths calculator 

//HTML, CSS
User interface: 
GUI representing the face of a traditional handheld calculator:

Buttons for numbers through 0-9
Buttons for add, subtract, multiply, divide and 'equals'
Buttons to 'delete' any mistake when clicking on keys and another to "clear" the display and the calculator 'memory' to start afresh

Representation of LED number display, within a vertical rectangular container (the calculator plastic 'casing')

//HTML, CSS, Javascript
Functionality: 
Maths operations 
Keys visibly depress on click 
Numbers and sum results appear in display  

// HTML, JavaScript
Input: 
user input (numbers) by clicking on calculator buttons 

//HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Output: 
number in 'calculator' display 

Inputs / Outputs 

1) When the user inputs a number by clicking on a number button, it shows in the display
2) When the user inputs an operator (+ - * /) it also shows in the display
3) When the user inputs a second number, it also shows in the display
4) When the user clicks on the equals button, calculate & display the sum created by all input if order was 1), 2), 3)   
5) When the user clicks on the clear button, delete all values and reset the display to '0'


Steps

// JavaScript
1) Functions and test in console 
add
subtract
multiply
divide

2) "Function 'operate' that takes an operator and 2 numbers and then calls one of the above functions on the numbers", test in console // JavScript 


// HTML
// CSS (style colourways, rounded corners, size, animation & layout)
3) Represent the face of a traditional handheld calculator with:

    buttons numbered 0 through 9
    + - / *   and = buttons
    animation  (visible button depression on click)
    'LED display'     
    'clear' button
    delete button for mistakes trying to click on desired buttons
    . (decimal point) button 


// HTML, JavaScript
4) Function renders number in display onclick (number buttons), store value displayed in variable  // HTML, JavaScript

on click clear button 'deletes' existing values to  & renders "0" in display

"=" button does not do anything if operation() not called 

Delete button removes any value input immediately before it

. (decimal point) button disabled after one click . per number input before operand chosen and one click. per number afterwards (cannot produce 1.2.3 x 4.5.6, for example, only 1.2 x 4.5)


5) Function stores values on number button click, on operand button click, on number button click,  then calls operation() 
   Else renders an error message if input uses a 0 to divide by 
   Render result in display on "=" button click with number rounded to manageable sized row of decimal places 
   Sequence can be repeated using result as first value in next operation


// JavaScript
6. New function calls function 5) when user presses key (onkeydown) corresponding to a number or maths operator. 
   User has choice of clicking on buttons or pressing keys on keyboard.
